# Percentage-To-CGPA-Calculator
This is my very first JavaScript project that I created when I had just joined college, about 9 months ago. Itâ€™s a simple web-based calculator that converts Percentage â†’ CGPA using the 10.0 grading scale.

ðŸ”¹ Features:

Converts percentage into CGPA instantly.

Input validation for values between 0â€“100.

Light/Dark theme toggle for better user experience.

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no external libraries).

ðŸ’¡ This project holds a special place for me because it was my first webpage with JavaScript and gave me the confidence to start building more projects.
